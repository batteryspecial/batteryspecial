## 👋 Hi, I'm Qinkai

I'm a first-year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo who enjoys building things, figuring problems out, and learning by doing.

I don’t claim to know everything — but I’m comfortable diving into unfamiliar systems, debugging my way through them, and shipping working solutions.

## 🛠 What I’m Working On

- Backend and full-stack projects (APIs, auth flows, databases)
- Web-based tools and applications with real users
- Research-driven software supporting bio and data-related work

Recent projects include:
- **CampusYap** – a location-aware campus discussion platform (Flask, SQLAlchemy)
- **Q.E.D** – a LaTeX-enabled rich text editor (Next.js, Slate.js)
- **Connect 4 AI** – a minimax-based game AI (Java)

## 🚀 Background

My interest in programming started early through projects like a Connect 4 AI and iGEM-related research.  
After competing in hackathons in 2023–2024, I shifted my focus toward building software more seriously.

Since then, I’ve worked on:
- Web development projects and startups
- Engineering-focused student teams
- Research environments where software supports real-world work

I’m currently continuing to learn and build through coursework, projects, and research.
