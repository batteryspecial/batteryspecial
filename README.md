## Hello 👋
I'm Qinkai, a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.<br>
I'm not really good at coding, but I can figure things out (trust the process 😅😅😅).

## About Me
- I started growing interests in programming (Connect 4 AI) and bio research (iGEM) in middle school, although I spent most of my time running [dungeons](https://sky.shiiyu.moe/stats/notsoSwifyte/Grapes).
- I co-founded [Chinook Curiosity Central](https://chinookcuriositycentral.vercel.app/) in 2023. The website was developed in Next.js and Bootstrap.
- In 2024 and 2025, I won my first hackathons, and finally decided to focus. I continued doing web development and physics research.
- In 2025-2026 (right now) I'm still learning and building (CampusYap, QED, research, etc.).
