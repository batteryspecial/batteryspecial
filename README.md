## Hello 👋
I'm Qinkai, a first-year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.<br>
I'm not really good at coding, but I can figure things out (trust the process 😅😅😅).

## About Me
- I started growing interests in programming (Connect 4 AI) and bio research (iGEM) in middle school, although I spent most of my time running [dungeons](https://sky.shiiyu.moe/stats/notsoSwifyte/Grapes).
- In 2023 and 2024, I won my first [hackathons](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/theknowledgesociety_tks-students-competed-at-the-energy-disruptors-activity-7247957453475082241-Gpbv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFDyYIEBU0w4I5Vy9xrSd8H9UCZCAJ_mG7g), and finally decided to shift focus. A turning point.
- I continued web development (eg. [Chinook Curiosity Central](https://chinookcuriositycentral.vercel.app/), which I co-founded in 2023) and physics research from 2024-2025.
- In 2025-2026 (right now) I'm still learning and building (CampusYap, QED, research, etc.).

I'm still jobless... but that might change.
